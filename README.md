# GPT2WordSalad
A quick gpt-2 model finetuned on my movie reviews and scholarship essays. Produces gibberish with less than 100 runs and is super overfit past it. Garbage in, Garbage out. And I can't really say that the quality of my normal writing is anything but garbage - so the combination of bad writing and bad techniques just doesn't really work too well.

###  Example Excerpts

This was the first sample text produced after the 50th model. I don't know where the wikipedia link came from - The gene stuff is probably from my Selfish Gene review -  but as far as I can tell Narnoo is a comepletely made up word.

*"A nice write up after the 
decentralized scope of the Narnoo genealogical network was released 
a few months later. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narnoo_(geniere)
The most entertaining part of the book was the briefer, 
emulteated clip series on the microbe count and the more general epiphysemiases in the context of the 
microbial musical chairs musical chairs. 
I remember reading it when I first read it at the time thinking that it was the 
longest read writing that way because it made me feel like I was paying more attention than 
I actually had to. The epigraphs that form the basis of all of the music both live 
and sing in interesting ways. The drone sounds that I remember hearing when I first read the book 
and the repetitive squealing that I then repeated several more times after I finished reading the book was an 
common musical style that I went into all but unimpressed by the final chapter."*



From Model 200+, it get's better (kinda?) in that it starts producing original content. These extracts in particular seem to combine my scholarship essay about the Metaverse and my science fiction book reviews.

 *"Gyllenge and the like. The problem is that the solution to the problem is often explicitly stated in the chapter names and the names of places are often hidden in plain sight, making the whole experience less than impressive.*

*At the same time, the things that make a difference is usually the main focus of the story, and the thing that matters in the Metaverse the most is called 
Meta Knight Biography. The Metaverse was the target of the Bane cyborgs' plan, and the organization quickly lost track of the Infinitesif. The plan went horribly, horribly wrong, and millions of people were killed in the process. Millions of people are at risk of being eaten by Geist if the plan goes awry, and the Metaverse needs your help sending there bounty hunters to find them. The plan also raises some serious ethical and moral questions, namely, do not let evil minions rule over good people, and what is the proper relationship between morality and malicious attacks on one's health or property?*

*The main problem with the plan is that it is extremely easy to butcher, sell, or hand out tech to evil corporations, and it is easy to see why the Metaverse would want to do so. The only problem is the transfer pricing, which would free up space for other uses, such as hospitals and research facilities. The answer to the question of how to make the Metaverse profitable is much more difficult to answer than it could be, because the answer to the question is much harder to find than it could have been. The solution, of course, is the Metaverse itself, which seems to be on a very good terms with everyone who reads his book, even though everybody is different. I reviewed the book on a high-protein, low-carb, and ketogenic schedule, and it looked pretty OK. The list of uses for the Metaverse goes on and on, with more and more people using it as a data centre or data center for analytics and testing, and as data mines for weapons of mass destruction. The Metaverse itself seems to be enjoying a renaissance, having surpassed the pet store industry in popularity and has recently become a hotspot for new talent. The city seems to have blossomed into a bustling metropolis with more open ended character references and a vibrant literary scene. I also was unaware that the hackers that were being tracked were being targeted at some point, which made the metaverse much more of a hotspot for hackers than a city.*

*As always with a Ted Chiang short story, you can instantly tell that it is well researched and went through tons of revisions to get it just right. The pacing also was kind of weird, with plot points that weren't obvious to the eye and characters that I didn't really understand almost immediately. The new technologies coming out of the Pentagon was kind of a mixed bag, with some of them being better than others. The new bioweapon called the Biosphere Extraction Weapon (boom) was really only a lighthouse for an apartment building, but it did make everything else pretty much straightaway. The new slang for "3.0" was eventually added to the mix, and it was actually pretty easy to figure out which ones who were who before you knew it. The new emblems and numbers made everything pretty much standard again. "*
